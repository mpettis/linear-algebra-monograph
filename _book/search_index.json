And you may ask yourself, Where does that highway go to? And you may ask yourself, Am I right? Am I wrong? And you may say to yourself, My God! What have I done?  Talking Heads, Once in a Lifetime What one fool can do, another can.  Ancient Simian Proverb  Sylvanus Thompson, Calculus Made Easy Everything is the way it is because it got that way.  DArcy Wentworth Thompson Id like to say Im writing this for the democratization of science and math, but really, for my kids and their friends so that they dont get snookered into thinking this stuff is beyond them and therefore not for them. It is for you. It is everybodys birthright. One of the best things about science, but one Ive found least talked about in the classes that I took in high school and college, is the part that explains why do we think things work this way? Why do we believe things are made up of atoms? Why did people believe that without the ability to see atoms? What is it about the technology weve built that confirms that things are made of atoms? We believe things like this because we concocted hypotheses and made experimental tests that ruthlessly and cumulatively. We make assumptions that are verifiably true, and then we reach a little further with logic and some more subtle observations, and extend the things we get to conclude, and what we have to throw away. That is a powerful process. Somewhere along the way, math got divorced from that process. It wasnt helped by great mathematicians like Carl Gauss who called Number Theory the Queen of Mathematics mostly because it didnt have much in the way of application, and that was a good thing. Or the eminent mathematician G. H. Hardy, who said, I have never done anythinguseful. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world. The perspective was, and often is, that math is a thing more akin to art, like poetry, and though it is sometimes useful, its main value is in that it is beautiful and fun. Ironically, his favorite subject, number theory, is the foundation of our ability to transmit secrets safely on the internet, and does, in fact, probably cause more good and ill than he was comfortable with. The downside of such a perspective is that it makes it seem like learning the discipline of mathematics is inscrutable. When you encounter mathematical definitions, such as, What makes a thing a vector space? or What makes a thing a group? or What makes a set measureable? what you read are a bunch of seemingly awkward little statements that seem either indecipherable, or unknowable, or so stupidly dead-simple as to make you wonder why one would even need to say such a thing. For instance, when we get to the definition of a vector space, youll see this as a defining characteristic that your, uh, well call a thingy for now, needs to have to be called a vector space: \\[ (\\vec{x} + \\vec{y}) + \\vec{z} = \\vec{x} + (\\vec{y} + \\vec{z}) \\] For those familiar with how numbers work, this seems like something Captain Obvious would say about math. It could also make you wonder whats the point of saying such a thing? These definitions dont come in an inspiration, like Athena springing fully formed from the forehead of Zeus. When you study the history of mathematics, youll see that when trying to come up with descriptions like this, mathematicians will often argue, and even disagree violently. Youll often see different characterizations like this depending on where you look, because originators disagreed on what was fundamental about what was going on. For systems to be compatible, though, the fundamental assumptions of one camp need to be at least derivable from the other, and vice versa. This monograph is intended give you the motivations of why linear algebra is the way it is. It will address: Where do those rules about a vector space come from? Whats the big deal about linear independence? What would make you come up with an idea like an inner product? Whats helpful about orthogonality? Eigenvectors: how do they even work? Ill approach this as science would ideally approach this. What do we observe? What sort of simplifications can we make to help us understand what is going on? What sort of models help us understand the important parts? "],["well-how-did-i-get-here.html", "Chapter 2 Well, How Did I Get Here?", " Chapter 2 Well, How Did I Get Here? Note: I am going to give a physical motivation for vectors here. If you know this pretty well, feel free to skip it. Lets dive in by making up a scenario that is half-realistic in the surroundings, and half fantasy in the activities you choose to engage in. The former grounds us in images we can relate to, the latter reminds us that scientists do think of weird things to with their time, and those things are often fruitful to humanity. Living in Minnesota, you discover that one of the recreations is pushing things around on ice sheets. We are a fascinating lot. So, lets imagine you are on a frozen lake with a liter bottle of vodka. This activity is commonly known as ice fishing here, though many people never come home with fish. So you decide to just kick the bottle around for a while before you drink it. While doing this, you make some pretty obvious observations that surprise no one at this point, but for some reason, stick with you. They are: The harder you push on the bottle, the faster it ends up going. The bottle goes in the direction you push it. Yes, you are a genius for making this observation. As I said, half of the things we do in the story are fantastical things you really wouldnt do with a bottle of vodka on the ice. Still bored, you decide to try and be more precise about your observations. So, you decide that you will only push on the bottle for one second spans of time. When you do this, you make these observations. If you push twice as hard on the bottle, it will end up going twice as fast. No matter how hard you push, the bottle still goes in the direction you push it. Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead. In this scenario, I assume you have some way of guaging what twice as hard means. For you physics buffs out there, yes, this is measuring the force you apply to the bottle. After much hard thinking, you decide to start recording your observations. Since the final speed and direction of the bottle depend only on how hard you push it and what direction you push, you decide to start keeping track of each combination of effort and direction with a drawn arrow.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
