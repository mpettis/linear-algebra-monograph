# What is This Beautiful House?

As with most useful finds in life, you grope around blindly in the darkness for a long time, stumbling and swearing, messing up, giving up, coming back, and sometimes tripping over something useful. If what you trip over is really useful, you take it to the garage, clean and polish it, put it on display, and tell lies about how you followed a primrose path, stemming from your genius, to its discovery, making people in awe of you.

We're going to follow that a bit.  It will have some convenient lies that will have enough grains of truth in it to be helpful.  I don't pretend to know the history of how linear algebra came into its present form, but I have made a satisfying hero's origin story narrative that has helped me keep important notions straight.  I'll tell that lie here.


## Going Backwards

The approach I'll take here is to start with $\mathbb{R}^2$, and work up to more general abstractions.  We'll start with the most commonly understood stuff, and then start to wiggle stuff around to see what happens and how we can use it.  We will rely on things we know intuitively about Euclidian space, like being able to construct perpendicular and parallel lines, measure lengths and angles, and the like.  Then we will start to erase and replace things with more abstract concepts, until we get to a level of some abstract generality.  With this established, we will hop over to the vector space of quantum states, and we'll be able to pull over the general abstractions, as some of the concrete intuitions don't work in quantum vector spaces.

To recap the highlights:

- You are given two unit vectors that are perpendicular to each other, $\vec{v1}$ and $\vec{v2}$.
- You are given the vector $\vec{r}$
- You figure out the way to write $\vec{r}$ in terms of $\vec{v1}$ and $\vec{v2}$ by dropping perpendiculars to the lines determined by $\vec{v1}$ and $\vec{v2}$, and then figuring out the ratio of the length of those intersections to the origin to the length of the individual unit vectors.  We call those lengths $a1$ and $a2$ respectively.
- You can then write $\vec{r}$ as follows:

$$\vec{r} = a1 \cdot \vec{v1} + a2 \cdot \vec{v2}$$ 

The big idea here is that, because we can draw perpendiculars and measure lengths, it's easy to compute the scalars $a1$ and $a2$.

I contend that it is pretty self-evident here that the following two statements are true:

- You can figure out the scalars (also known as *components*) for $a1$ and $a2$ for *any* vector $\vec{r}$, no matter the size or direction.
- If you have $\vec{r}$ in hand, the values you compute for $a1$ and $a2$ are unique -- you can't use some other way of constructing parallels and measuring lengths, and legitimately come up with different numbers.

This seems like a boring observation, but, as I've said before, this will be important.
