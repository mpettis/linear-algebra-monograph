# Well, How Did I Get Here?

Most linear algebra textbooks I've read have the axioms of a vector space within the first 3 pages.  It is a bad way to start, because you really have no frame of reference for what any of the terms mean.  It is frustrating and made me angry.

Let's start how every linear algebra book starts, **but know that we shouldn't really start here.** And we won't, in the traditional sense.

From Wikipedia:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="[Record scratch]  Yep, that's me, Vector Space, spewing a lot of incomprehensible stuff.  But I wasn't always like this.  Let me tell you a story..."}

```

This reminds me of the joke about a cab driver driving around the Seattle area in a fog, and he asks a guy coming out of a building if he can tell the cabbie where he is.  The guy looks at him and says, "You're in a cab," and walks on.  The cabbie says "Perfect, I know where I am."  The fare asks him how he can figure out anything from what the guy outside said, and the cabbie say, "Well, he told me something that was completely true and completely useless.  So this must be the Microsoft building."

There's so many questions that should be triggered.  Like:

- What are vectors, really?
- What is a field, really?
- What does it mean to add vectors?
- What does it mean to multiply a vector by a scalar?
- How do I know what other vector $a \cdot \vec{u}$ becomes?
- It looks like the scalar field talks about how *scalar addition* and *scalar multiplication* works.  But vectors only talk about *vector addition*.  What's up with that?

The way I do think about this is, **assuming I know the answer to the above questions**, is:

- Vector addition works the way you think it should, it kinda-sorta works like regular numbers.
- Scalar multiplication works the way you think it should, it kinda-sorta works like regular numbers.
- Scalars, coming from the field, can have both addition and multiplication.  But vectors only have addition.
